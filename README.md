# Drum Performer

Drum Performer (tentatively named) is a rhythm game under development that doubles as a legitimate learning tool for drummers. Users will be able to connect their electronic drum kit to the game and play songs that users transcribe for the game. Users will hear their drumming through drum sample libraries built into the game. Unlike other drum-focused rhythm games, the songs in Drum Performer feature exact transcriptions, not simplified representations.

# Features

-Users can play with any sized electronic drum kit, from an entry-level kit to a massive modular setup. The game adapts its charts to fit each drum kit.

-Users can customize the appearance of their highway, including the positioning, color, and size of each gem.

-When playing a song, the user will hear the correct drum sample at the correct time, regardless of kit size. Perhaps a user has three cymbals (hi-hat, crash, ride), but the song the user is playing has a fourth cymbal (splash). The user chooses which of their three cymbals the splash is mapped to, and the game will switch between samples as the user is playing through the song.

-Musical notation is optionally viewable alongside the highway, in a panorama or page view.

-The base game will come with one drum sample pack covering the basic drum kit, and users can purchase drum sample packs that add new drums, cymbals, and mixes to their collection of drums. These drum samples can be assigned per song.

-A lesson mode is planned that will feature interactive video lessons on various drum techniques, with original music written specifically for the game that act as tecnhique-specific challenges.
